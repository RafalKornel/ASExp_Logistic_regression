# Allegro summer experience 2020 - data science

This project was rectuitment task, for 2020 Allegro summer internship in
data science field. Despite not getting internship, I consider it to be 
very enriching experience, and I'm satisfied with my results. 

The task was to write (without external ML libraries) and train 
on MNIST data set, a model that would predict if hand wrote digit 
is primary or complex. It had to implement *Stochastic gradient descent* with momentum
on logistic regresion. 

A complete overview of results is included in *sprawozdanie.pdf*, but in Polish.
